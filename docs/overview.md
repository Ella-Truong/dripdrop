#Project Overview

## Purpose

My goal is to built a **full-stack web application** using **JavaScript** and through this project, I would have a deep understand about how **data flow through the entire system**, from the user interface to the backend and database, and back to the user.

This project focuses less on "just making features" and more on understanding **what actually happens step by step** in a real application.

Building this project helps me answer quesitons: 
- What happens when a user types my website URL in the browser or clicks a link to my site?
- How does the frontend render the first page the user sees?
- How does the backend handle requests and fetch data from the database?
- How is the page delivered to the user, and how does the app update dynamically after that?
